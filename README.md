# NBA salaries exploration

This project is an exploratory data analysis of basketball performance indicators and players salaries using R. The project includes univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis sections and a linear model which tries to explain a players salary through variables of his game performance. 

The exploration is based on a dataset of NBA salaries covering the past ten years and players performance statistics from NBA seasons from 2007/2008 to 2016/2017. 

The datasets were taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats/home) and from data.world (https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries/). The source for both datasets originally was the website https://www.basketball-reference.com/. The final dataset used for the analysis was merged from the datasets described above and filtered so that we have statistics on players performance and their salaries going back 10 years.
